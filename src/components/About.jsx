      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className="about-blurb">
        I am a recent graduate of the Web Development program at FullStack
        Academy's Grace Hopper Program. A native of the Bay Area, I attended
        undergrad at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN where I studied
        vocal performance. After graduation, I spent many years auditioning and
        performing in NYC, and eventually found my way into recruiting. When I
        lost my recruiting job to layoffs, it seemed like just the right time to
        pursure something that I had been considering for a long time- software
        engineering!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        When I'm not coding I can still be found singing at home or around NYC,
        baking celiac-friendly treats, or hanging out with my three-legged cat,
        Beignet.
