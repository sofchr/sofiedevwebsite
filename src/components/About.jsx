      <p className="about-blurb">
        A native of the Bay Area, I attended undergrad at Vanderbilt University
        in Nashville, TN where I studied vocal performance. I spent many years
        auditioning and performing in NYC, and eventually found my way into
        recruiting. When I lost my recruiting job to layoffs, it seemed like
        just the right time to pursure something that I had been considering for
        a long time- software engineering!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I completed the Grace Hopper Program web development
        certification, where I gained experience building full stack web
        applications, primarly in the PERN stack. I love to create efficient
        solutions to problems, and express my creativity while doing it. I am
        excited to learn and grow in an engineering role where I can approach
        new challenges with a musician's mindsetâ€”creatively, disciplined in
        practice, collaborative in spirit, and committed to continuous
        improvement.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        When I'm not coding, I can still be found singing around NYC, playing
        puzzle games, baking celiac-friendly treats, or hanging out with my
        three-legged cat, Beignet.
